ChangeLog for KRepton                             -*- mode:text -*-
=====================


Changes from version 4.4 to version 5.0:
---------------------------------------
Ported to Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5.

The KDE Games library (libkdegames) is used if available.  This means
that a system wide high score list is maintained (if libkdegames is
configured to use one) and game sounds can be played in quick
succession.  The former sound options (Phonon or external player)
are still available.  High scores are not available if not using
libkdegames.

The map turns grey when paused.

The route that spirits will take can be shown on the map editor.  This
reflects the situation as it stands at the time:  that is, it does not
take account of objects falling or an earlier spirit following the
same route and getting caught in a cage.

The display settings in the map editor are persistent.

The map or sprite editor object list shows sprite images.



Changes from version 4.4 to version 4.5:
---------------------------------------
Spirits will try to recover if they get trapped or confused.

Cheat modes are available to turn off various dangerous things.

Multiple sound schemes: as well as the original KRepton sounds those
from Repton 1, Repton 2 and Repton 3 are available.



Changes from version 4.3 to version 4.4:
---------------------------------------
KDE4 port.

No high score recorded for a trivial game (less than 2000 points).

When entering a new high score try to get the user's full name (from
systemsettings) first, a bit more friendly then the plain user name.

Tidied up tooltip and new "started" graphic for the level selection
dialogue.

Introduced a 'monster grace time' where it will stand still after birth.
Gives an adjacent falling rock time to ensure that it will fall on the
monster and kill it, with no chance for the monster to move and escape.

Also restore the similar 'plant grace time' after the level start,
somehow lost in the GIT conversion.



Changes from version 4.2 to version 4.3:
---------------------------------------
Sources converted to GIT.
No user-visible changes.



Changes from version 4.1 to version 4.2:
---------------------------------------
Allow per-level sprite files, so that imported episodes where the
palette varies between levels (notably the 3 original episodes
Prelude, Toccata and Finale) can be accurately reproduced.  Backwards
and forwards compatible.

Levels removed from Prelude(E) episode, now sprites only - its maps
were the same as the original.

Added a tooltop to explain the level selection dialogue.



Changes from version 4.0 to version 4.1:
---------------------------------------
Added an import wizard to allow game files in other formats to be imported.
Currently the only format supported is BBC Repton 3 (and sequels).

Successfully completed levels are now saved in the user configuration, so
allowing levels to be continued or played again (via the "Start at level"
option) without having to specify the password.

The game playing logic for some of the characters has been changed to
be more faithful to the original (which could affect the playing of
certain levels):

  -  A rock falling onto a broken egg will now rest there until it hatches
     and then kill the monster; previously the rock would just roll off
     the broken egg.

  -  Growing plants can replicate onto a monster and kill it.

  -  A monster which is in a straight line from Repton but is blocked by a
     solid object between them can try to move one square right or down
     to try to get round the obstacle.

Many thanks to those on the Stairway To Hell forums,
http://www.stairwaytohell.com, who provided information.

The corrupted "Baby II" and "Work" episodes are now fixed and playable
(but not able to verify if they are completable).



Changes from version 3.0.1 to version 4.0:
-----------------------------------------
Integrated the separate "Game" and "Editor" applications into a single
one (and, of course, a single source base and future KDevelop project).

Changed the game selection and playing user interface to a more
"document"-like model.  A game episode is "loaded" and from then on
all playing and editing operations apply to that, so allowing a single
action key to start or restart playing.

Too many changes to mention to the episode file management and the user
interface as a result of those.

Other enhancements:

Cache pixmaps (in new class 'Pixmaps') to avoid searching for files
every time.  Centralise sprite management in new class 'Sprites'.
Converted all graphics from proprietary BMP to unencumbered PNG.

Repton has three lives, as in the original BBC game.  The number of
lives remaining is shown in the status bar.

Added a "Clear" button for the high score history.

Repton starts to look round if he stands still for too long, as in the
original BBC game.

Added a "Display Size" option to play the game either as before, or
half or double the size.  Scaling is handled internally in the
'Sprites' class.

The editor can now show the transporter routes (very useful for
verifying that they go to the right place), and the selected
transporter (for verifying that the intended one is chosen).

Map and sprite editor windows simplified a lot by using higher-level
Qt classes rather than managing the scroll bars and the object preview
explicitly.  List of map objects handled in a common class
'ObjectList'.  Map and sprite coordinate box display handled in a
common class 'CoordLabel'.

Player and editor 'Map' classes combined into a hierarchy.  Points
tracking moved from map to parent class to handle multiple levels.
Playing sounds handled in new class 'Sound'.  Much unnecessary
repainting of game window optimised.

Episode 'blank' renamed to 'simple' (because it wasn't!), for testing
and practice.  New, really blank, episode 'blank' added as a base for
creating new episodes using the editor.

Removed the splash screen.

Report the 'errno' message, wherever possible and appropriate, for
file operations.

Other bugs fixed:

Set WRepaintNoErase for main game display widget to eliminate flicker.

Editor password field no longer loses focus when typing, when there is
only one level.


Changes from version 3.0 to version 3.0.1:
----------------------------------------- 
Fixed geometry setting problem that sometimes left an unpainted strip
along the bottom of the game window.

Graphical icons used for key and crown in status bar.

Fixed bug which corrupted sprites when saving episode from editor.
Simple "blank" episode available for starting new one.


Game - Changes from version 2.0 to version 3.0:
---------------------------------------------- 
Set up as a KDevelop project - this necessitated splitting up the game
and editor applications into two separate distributions, as currently
KDevelop doesn't handle building more than one application from one
source base.

Lots of conversion for for KDE 3 - use its classes whenever available
rather than the original QT versions, use QT Designer to build the
dialogues, use the KMainWindow/KAction framework for the menus and key
shortcuts.  Updated use of some Qt classes (QList<type*> -> QPtrList
etc).  Update resources searching and audio playing to use the new KDE
interfaces.

Added an indicator in the status bar to show when the "crown" has been
taken.

Allowed a rock falling on a broken egg to kill the monster (BBC Repton
did that, but in original KRepton it just rolled off :-(

Updated the startup splash screen.

Updated the high scores display - now in a column list with sorting.
The user's Unix login name is filled in as a default.

Cache some bitmaps in the game widget object ('bg' etc) so that the
resource file search isn't done on every repaint event.

Editor - Changes from version 2.0 to version 3.0:
------------------------------------------------
Lots of conversion for for KDE 3 - use its classes whenever available
rather than the original QT versions, use QT Designer to build the
dialogues, use the KMainWindow/KAction framework for the menus and key
shortcuts.  Updated use of some Qt classes (QList -> QPtrList etc).
Update resources searching to use the new KDE interfaces.

Fixed a number of null-pointer crashes (mostly in event handlers - is
this a consequence of the now multithreaded Qt?).

Added an application icon.

Editor main window: fade buttons where not allowed or applicable,
added an option to change an existing transporter.

Renamed "Strict Check"ing to "Consistency Check"ing to better describe
its function.  Added some more tests - transporter destination should
be blank (warning only), some rocks are available if eggs are present.
Split all the checking out into a new class CheckMap in its own source
files.  Report all of the problems, not just the first one found.

Split out most of the episode locating, loading and saving into a new
class FileIO, in its own source files.

Warn and ask when exiting the editor, if the episode has been edited
but not saved.


From here on is from the original HTML documentation
