KRepton Installation Instructions
=================================

KRepton is now ported to KDE4 and so uses CMake.

To compile and install, clone the Git repository or download and
extract the source archive, and then create a separate build
directory.  Change into the newly created build directory and then do:

  cmake /path/to/source/directory

This will eventually do the installation into the same place as
KDE4 is currently installed.  To install to somewhere else, use
instead:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path /path/to/source/directory

After the cmake configuration has finished, do:

  make
  sudo make install
