KRepton Installation Instructions
=================================

KRepton is now ported to KDE Frameworks 5 and so uses CMake.  The
external dependencies and their minimum versions required are:

  Qt				5.14.0		qt.io
  KDE Frameworks		5.60.0		kde.org
  libkdegames (optional)	7.3.0		kde.org
  CMake				3.0		cmake.org

  libkfdialog			github.com/martenjj/libkfdialog

All of these apart from the last should be available as standard
packages for your distro.

To compile and install, clone the Git repository or download and
extract a source archive, and then create a separate build
directory.  Change into the newly created build directory and then do:

  cmake /path/to/source/directory

This will eventually do the installation into the same place as KDE
Frameworks are currently installed.  To install to somewhere else, use
instead:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path /path/to/source/directory

After the cmake configuration has finished, do:

  make
  sudo make install
