<H1>KRepton User Manual</H1>

<P>
<IMG SRC="screenshot.png" ALIGN="right" HEIGHT="312" WIDTH="394" BORDER="2" HSPACE="10">

KRepton is an implementation of the classic Repton&nbsp;3 game, which
was originally produced for the BBC Micro and was the third hit Repton
game for Superior Software.

<P>
It was originally written by
<A HREF="http://www.sigala.it/sandro/">Sandro Sigala</A>
for Linux using the SVGAlib library, and then rewritten entirely using
the QT and KDE libraries for release 1.0 of KDE.

<P>
KRepton was converted to KDE&nbsp;3 and this version is currently
maintained by
<A HREF="http://www.keelhaul.demon.co.uk/">Jonathan Marten</A>.

<P>
Sandro is continuing to maintain Repton as
<A HREF="http://www.sigala.it/sandro/software.html#fxrepton">FX-Repton</A>,
using the portable
<A HREF="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">Fox Toolkit</A>.
So if you want to run the game on Windows(TM), or any other system
that doesn't have KDE, then get this version.

<H2>How to Play</H2>

The only keys you need to use to play the game are the four arrow
keys. The objective is to move Repton around to collect all of the
diamonds on each level, and then get the bomb before time runs out.

<P>
Some diamonds are initially visible, and they can be collected easily.
Some others may be concealed in strongboxes; somewhere on the level
will be a key which can be taken to open the strongboxes.

<P>
There may be wandering spirits on the level, either free or initially
confined in an enclosed space.  They move around always following the
wall or any other solid object to their left; you should attempt to
lead them to a cage where they will get trapped and change into a
diamond, which you can then collect.  You may need to clear passages
or openings, or block others, by dropping or pushing rocks, but be
careful to leave yourself a free path to reach the rest of the level!

<P>
Monster eggs will hatch if they fall, and the monster will pursue you
remorselessly.  Kill the monster by pushing or dropping a rock onto it.

<P>
Watch out for replicating plants: these spread slowly through any open
space and can trap you.  Stop the plants spreading by enclosing them
with rocks.

<P>
Search for and collect a golden crown to earn a further points bonus.

<P>
Some levels may have a short time limit, but if you are lucky there
will be some time bonus objects which you can collect to gain more
time.  You can pause the action at any time using the
<KBD>P</KBD>
key or by selecting
<B>Pause</B>
from the
<B>Game</B>
menu.

<P>
You will die if you touch a spirit, monster, plant or skull, if a rock
or egg falls on you, or if time runs out.  If you get stuck, then you
may commit suicide using the
<KBD>Escape</KBD>
key or by selecting
<B>Suicide</B>
from the
<B>Game</B>
menu.

<P>
In episodes other than Prelude, Toccata and Finale, the objects may
change.  Their use and the objectives are exactly the same.  Take
care, in some episodes the objects may not be what they seem!


<P>
<H2>Episodes and Levels</H2>

To select an episode, use
<B>Select Game</B>
from the
<B>File</B>
menu and choose the episode that you wish to play.  To start at the
beginning of the first level, select
<B>Start at first level</B>
from the
<B>Game</B>
menu.

<P>
You start the game with three lives.  If you are killed or commit
suicide, and you have some lives remaining, you may restart at the
same location where you last entered the level or passed through a
transporter. Unfortunately there may now be no exit from here, so take
care not to get killed at all costs.  If it is impossible to continue
then you will have to abandon the game, losing all your remaining
lives.

<P>
When you have successfully completed a level, you will be given a
password for the next.  You can restart the episode from that level,
at another time, by selecting
<B>Restart at level</B>
from the
<B>Game</B>
menu and entering the same password.

<P>
If you lose all of your lives or have to abandon the game, you may
start again at the beginning of the last level you played by selecting
<B>Restart last level</B>
from the
<B>Game</B>
menu.

<P>
For additional variety (or simply to make some levels playable&nbsp;-
very useful with
<B>Future</B>
or
<B>OAP</B>, for example!),
you may play the levels from one game using the graphics from another.
First select the game episode, then select
<B>Change Sprites</B>
from the
<B>Settings</B>
menu and choose the level from which you want to take the graphics. If
you want to save a copy of the original episode with the new graphics,
use
<B>Save As</B>
as described below.


<P>
<H2>Editing and Files</H2>

An editor to allow episodes, maps and graphics to be created and
changed is now integrated into the application.  To edit an episode,
first load it as if you were intending to play the game and then
select
<B>Game Editor</B>
from the
<B>Editor</B>
menu.  The editor window will open showing the general episode
information.

<P>
See the
<A HREF="editor.html">editor documentation</A> for more detailed information on
editing the levels, maps and graphics.

<P>
If you have made changes in the editor, you may immediately start
playing the modified episode using any of the game options as
above. There is no need to save the episode first. If it is not
possible to play the episode in its current state (for example, some
essential objects are missing from any level) you will be informed of
this and the game will not start.

<P>
To permanently save the edited episode, use either
<B>Save</B>
or
<B>Save As</B>
from the
<B>File</B>
menu. You cannot directly modify the original episodes distributed
with the KRepton package, as they are installed in the global
read-only directory
<CODE>$KDEDIR/share/</CODE><CODE>apps/krepton/</CODE><CODE>episodes</CODE>.
So if you want to modify one of these original episodes, use
<B>Save As</B>
and enter a new name for the episode.
It will be stored in your personal directory
<CODE>$KDEHOME/share/</CODE><CODE>apps/krepton/</CODE><CODE>episodes</CODE>.
If you have loaded a personal episode that you have already copied or edited,
use
<B>Save</B>
to save it directly back to that location.

<P>
To delete an edited personal episode that you no longer require, select
<B>Remove</B>
from the
<B>File</B>
menu and select the episode to be removed. You will only be able to
select your own personal episodes in this list; the original
distributed episodes cannot be deleted.
