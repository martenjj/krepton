Things to do for KRepton
========================

Need some high colour and themed icons.

Convert the documentation to Docbook format and update it.
Internationalisation throughout.

Convert the game widget to a QCanvas (hopefully for better performance).
Same for the editor widget?

"Key" of object names and graphics (will need extra file in episode
listing them).

Import/export FX-Repton, original BBC and other format episodes.

Print the maps, in colour and with annotation of course!

Map editor option to display the route that the blips will take.  This
would be very useful for working out where they will go, but may take
a lot of coding.

More useful editing operations: cut/copy/paste, insert/delete
rows/columns, area fill, resize existing level.

Sprite and map editors: blank the coordinate box if the mouse is not
within the window.

Eliminate any remaining compiler warnings.

Global KDE games high score support (KDE 3.2).

Should plants kill monsters in the same way as they do Repton?  They
don't in KRepton, but I think they did in the original.


From the original HTML documentation
====================================

The Work and Baby II episodes are to be fixed because corrupted.

The KDE audio interface is inadequate for complex sound applications
like games. Need to find a best method for playing sounds.

Find more appropriate sounds (at least for broken egg and falling
objects).

Make the High Score board global, not local (this requires making the
score data globally writable).

Add keys redefinition support.

Comment the source code with kdoc.

Rewrite this documentation with the KDE SGML tools.

Draw more nice sprites (I'm not an artist, I need help!).
